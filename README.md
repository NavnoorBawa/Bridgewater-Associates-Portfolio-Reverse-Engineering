# Bridgewater Associates Portfolio Reverse Engineering

## Overview

This project reverse engineers Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates portfolio by analyzing the $21.55 billion holdings across 664 companies to identify the quantitative factors that explain position sizing decisions.

## Core Methodology

### Cross-Sectional Factor Analysis

The model performs cross-sectional analysis across all portfolio holdings at a single point in time, asking the fundamental question: **"What factors explain why certain stocks have larger position weights than others?"**

Unlike time-series analysis that tracks individual stocks over time, this approach examines the entire portfolio simultaneously to uncover the systematic factors driving allocation decisions.

## Factor Categories Analyzed

### 1. Value Factors
- Price-to-average ratios across multiple time horizons
- Mean reversion signals and contrarian indicators
- Volatility-based value proxies

### 2. Size Factors  
- Price level as market cap proxy
- Multi-horizon price stability measures
- Liquidity and trading activity indicators

### 3. Momentum Factors
- Multi-horizon return momentum (1 week to 12 months)
- Risk-adjusted momentum calculations
- Momentum acceleration and consistency metrics

### 4. Quality Factors
- Return consistency and positive return frequency
- Earnings quality proxies through trend analysis
- Drawdown recovery and resilience measures

### 5. Volatility Factors
- Multi-horizon volatility calculations
- Upside vs downside volatility analysis
- Volatility regime and clustering indicators

### 6. Technical Factors
- RSI and moving average signals
- Bollinger Band positioning
- Price channel and breakout indicators

### 7. Macro Factors
- Market beta and correlation analysis
- Interest rate sensitivity
- VIX correlation for defensive positioning

### 8. Sector Factors
- Sector beta and relative performance
- Sector correlation and divergence patterns
- Industry-specific risk exposures

## Statistical Validation Framework

### Multi-Method Approach
The analysis employs four complementary statistical methods to ensure robust factor identification:

1. **Enhanced Correlation Analysis** - Spearman and Pearson correlations between factor scores and position weights
2. **Quintile Analysis** - Examines monotonic relationships by sorting stocks into factor quintiles
3. **Regression Analysis** - Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression to identify significant coefficients
4. **Factor Scoring** - Multiple scoring methodologies (z-score, rank-based, percentile-based)

### Consensus Methodology
Factors must demonstrate significance across multiple statistical methods to be considered valid. The composite scoring system weights factors by both statistical significance and consensus strength across methodologies.

## Position Weight Analysis

### Core Hypothesis
Bridgewater's position weights are not random but follow systematic factor-based rules. Large position weights should correlate with specific factor combinations that align with their investment philosophy.

### Ranking System
- Stocks ranked by position weight (1 = largest holding)
- Quintile analysis to identify factor patterns
- Overweight vs underweight classification based on median weight

## Sector-Based Attribution

### Sector Decomposition
Portfolio holdings categorized into GICS sectors to understand:
- Sector-specific factor exposures
- Cross-sector factor consistency
- Sector rotation patterns

### Risk-Return Analysis
Each sector analyzed for:
- Expected returns vs realized volatility
- Factor exposure differences
- Concentration risk assessment

## Output and Insights

### Factor Importance Ranking
Factors ranked by composite importance score combining:
- Statistical significance (t-statistics, p-values)
- Explanatory power (R-squared values)
- Cross-method validation strength

### Position Explanation
For each holding, the model identifies:
- Primary factors driving position size
- Factor score percentiles
- Sector-relative positioning

### Portfolio-Level Patterns
Analysis reveals:
- Most influential factors across entire portfolio
- Factor consistency across different position sizes
- Systematic biases in allocation strategy

## Research Applications

### For Quantitative Researchers
- Factor model validation and enhancement
- Cross-sectional analysis methodology
- Institutional portfolio analysis techniques

### For Portfolio Managers
- Understanding systematic allocation patterns
- Factor-based portfolio construction insights
- Risk factor exposure identification

### For Academic Research
- Empirical validation of factor investing

- Portfolio construction theory application

## Key Innovation

This project represents the first comprehensive factor-based reverse engineering of Bridgewater's complete portfolio holdings, providing unprecedented insight into the quantitative decision-making process of the world's largest hedge fund.

The methodology can be applied to any institutional portfolio to decode the systematic factors driving allocation decisions.
